Step-by-Step: Install Anaconda (with Python) on Windows 11
1. Download Anaconda

Visit: 🔗 https://www.anaconda.com/download

Click “Download” under Windows (64-bit).

Choose the Python 3.x version (for example, Python 3.11 or 3.12).

This .exe file is around 600–800 MB.

2. Run the Installer

Once downloaded, double-click the file:
Anaconda3-2025.xx-Windows-x86_64.exe

Click Next

Accept the License Agreement

Choose Just Me (recommended)

Select the installation path (default is fine)

3. Advanced Options

You’ll see two checkboxes:

✅ Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable (optional — uncheck if you use other Python installations)

✅ Register Anaconda as my default Python 3.x (recommended)

Click Install and wait for it to finish (takes ~10 minutes).

4. Verify Installation

After setup completes:

Open Start Menu → Anaconda Prompt

Run:

python --version


You’ll see something like:

Python 3.12.3


Then verify Conda:

conda --version


Example output:

conda 24.7.1


That means Python and Conda are ready 🎉

5. Launch Anaconda Navigator

Open Anaconda Navigator from the Start Menu → this gives you a GUI to:

Open Jupyter Notebook

Launch Spyder IDE

Manage packages and environments easily
